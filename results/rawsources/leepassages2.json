In consequence, I\u2019m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought\u2014frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.\n", "ellipsisphrase": "", "subjectivetime": 0, "complete": true, "narratedtime": 7884000.0, "idx": 0}, {"subjectivephrase": "", "ellipsistime": 0, "text": "\n And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit.

When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction\u2014Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the \u201ccreative temperament\u201d\u2014it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.

A frenzy of adoration, hysterical and almost religious, swept through the people as he passed, and surged along before him. They fell to their knees, reaching out their hands toward him, sobbing, crying his name again and again.\n \n \u201cGod bless your Majesty!\u201d\n \n \u201cLong live the King!\u201d\n \n Charles rode slowly, smiling, raising one hand to them in greeting.\n \n He was tall, more than six feet, with a look of robust good health and animal strength. His physique was magnificent and never showed to better advantage than on horseback. The product of many nationalities, he looked far more a Bourbon or a Medici than he did a Stuart. His skin was swarthy, his eyes black, and he had an abundance of black shining hair that fell heavily to his shoulders and rolled over on the ends into great natural rings; when he smiled his teeth gleamed white beneath a narrow moustache. His features were harsh and strongly marked, seared by disillusion and cynicism, and yet in spite of that he had a glowing charm that went out to each of them, warming their hearts.\n \n They loved him on the instant.\n", "idx": 84}, {"complete": false, "text": "\n \n \n \n \n James\u2019s marriage to Anne Hyde created a considerable excitement. The Chancellor was furious; Anne wept incessantly; and the Duke still thought he might find a way out. With the help of Sir Charles Berkeley he stole the blood-signed contract and burned it, and Berkeley offered to marry her himself and give the child his name. The courtiers were in a quandary, not knowing whether they should pay their respects to the new Duchess or avoid her altogether, and only Charles seemed perfectly at ease.\n \n And then the Duke of Gloucester, who had fallen ill of small-pox but had been thought to be out of danger, died suddenly. Charles had loved him well, as he did all his family, and he had seemed a young man of great promise, eager and charming and intelligent. It was unbelievable that now he lay dead, still and solemn and never to move again. There had been nine children in the family. Two had died on the day of birth, two others had lived only a short while, and now there remained only Charles and James, Mary who was Princess of Orange, and Henrietta Anne, the youngest, still with her mother in France.\n \n But even the death of Henry could not halt the festivities for long. And though the Court managed to show a decent face of sorrow in the presence of Charles or James, the balls and the suppers, the flirtations and the gambling went on as before, wildly, madly, as though it would never be possible to get enough of pleasure and excitement.\n", "idx": 149}, {"complete": false, "text": "\n \u201cSir?\u201d\n \n The boy was flustered. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, your Ladyship.

As he looked Amber noticed that he wore four rings, had gold buttons on his coat with tiny diamonds in the centers, that his sword case was silver and that he wore a large mink muff attached to a broad twisted satin girdle.\n \n He gave her a bow, very stiff and dignified. \u201cI beg your pardon, madame. That is not my game, I assure you. Your servant, madame.\u201d He turned and would have gone off but she stopped him.\n \n \u201cSir!\u201d He looked around and she smiled up at him, her tawny eyes coaxing. \u201cForgive my rudeness. I fear the waiting has set me on edge. I\u2019ll accept your offer of wine, and thanks.\u201d\n \n He smiled, forgiving her instantly, sat down and summoned the waiter to order champagne for her and brandy for himself. He told her that his name was Tom Butterfield and that he was a student at Lincoln\u2019s Inn, but when he tried to find out who she was she grew cool and aloof, intimating that she was too well known to dare give her name. And she knew by the way he stared at her that he was trying to place her, wondering if she was Lady This or Countess That, and thinking that he was having a considerable adventure.\n", "idx": 288}, {"complete": false, "text": "\n \u201cVery well, madame,\u201d he said at last. \u201cBut before you go I think it would be wise to determine first if your mother will have you\u2014and to find out, I\u2019ll send your attendants before you.\u201d\n \n Catherine whirled around and stared at him with unbelieving astonishment.

Now, more than ever, when he was against her too, she needed them.\n \n \u201cOh, please, Sire!\u201d Her hands went out imploringly.\n \n He bowed. \u201cGood-night, madame.\u201d\n \n To the amused relief of the Court most of Catherine\u2019s ugly train departed within a few days, for Charles allowed only Penalva, the priests, and a few kitchen attendants to remain. He did not trouble to send so much as a letter of explanation with them, but he hoped the Dowager Queen would know that he was displeased because she had paid most of the dowry\u2014at the last moment\u2014in sugar and spices instead of in gold.\n \n For days the contest between them persisted.\n \n Catherine remained most of the time in her own rooms and, when she did appear, she and Charles scarcely spoke. When the courtiers met in the garden or at the cockpit they asked each other: \u201cAre you going to the Queen-baiting this afternoon?\u201d The young and gay wanted to see Barbara Palmer triumphant because she represented their own way of living; the older and more circumspect sympathized with the Queen but wished that she understood men better and had been taught that tact could often accomplish what blustering and threats could not. As usual, Charles heard advice from both camps, but though he listened politely to everyone he was no more influenced than usual. In any matter which he considered to be of importance to his comfort he made his own decisions\u2014and he did so now.\n", "idx": 404}, {"complete": false, "text": "\n \u201cHow long since you\u2019ve eaten?\u201d\n \n The girl swallowed, took another great bite and answered with her mouth full. \u201cTwo days, mam.\u201d\n \n \u201cYe gods! Here, take this and buy yourself a dinner.\u201d\n \n From a little velvet bag inside her muff she emptied several shillings and dropped them into the girl\u2019s lap. By now they had drawn up before the theatre and the footman came to open the door. Amber gathered her skirts and prepared to get out and the girl leaned forward, staring through the glass windows with great interest.\n \n \u201cLord, mam, are you goin\u2019 to the play?\u201d\n \n \u201cI\u2019m an actress.\u201d\n \n \u201cYou are!\u201d She seemed both pleased and shocked that her benefactress should be engaged in so exciting and disreputable a profession.

For one day, after some mention of King Charles, he said: \u201cHis Majesty could be the greatest ruler our nation has ever had but, unfortunately, not only for him but for all of us, the years of exile were his ruin. He learned a set of habits and a way of living during that time from which he can never escape\u2014partly, I\u2019m afraid, because he doesn\u2019t want to.\u201d\n \n Amber, stitching on a piece of embroidery borrowed from Nan\u2019s work-basket, observed soberly that she had heard Whitehall had grown a most wicked place.\n \n \u201cIt is wicked. Wicked and corrupt. Honour is a sham, virtue a laughing-stock, marriage the butt for vulgar jests. There are still decent and honest men aplenty at Whitehall, as everywhere else in England\u2014but knaves and fools elbow them aside.\u201d\n \n Most of their conversation, however, was less serious, and he seldom cared to discuss ethical or even political matters with her.

They found every member of the family who was home and old enough to walk assembled there to meet her. Almost thirty persons stood about the huge table, several of them children who would ordinarily have been eating in the nursery. Such large families were common among the richer middle-classes, for their children did not die in as large proportion as did those of the poor and their women made no effort to prevent child-bearing as did the fashionable ladies of Whitehall and Covent Garden.\n \n Now, as Amber and Samuel stood in the doorway, one little moppet inquired loudly: \u201cMother, is that the woman?\u201d Her mother administered a hasty embarrassed slap and followed it with a shake to keep her from crying.\n \n Samuel ignored this incident and began to make the introductions. Each person, when presented, came forward to bow, if a man, or to curtsy and give her a peck on the cheek if a woman. The children, staring round-eyed, likewise made their awkward bows and curtsies. It was obvious from their interest and awe that much had already been said among the grown-ups about the new Mrs. Dangerfield.\n", "idx": 587}, {"complete": false, "text": "\n They drifted out of the dining-room and back to the drawing-room to seat themselves about little round tables or on chairs and benches.

They sat down, plates on their laps, and began to talk.\n \n Jemima was chattering at him and smiling, her eyes ashine with happiness and passionate admiration as she plied on him all the pretty tricks of a natural flirt. Bruce sat and watched her and now and then he said something, but though he seemed only lazily amused Amber was in a state of anguished jealousy.\n \n She made several starts to go over and interrupt them, but each time someone stopped her. At last one old dowager with a bosom like a shelf and the face of a petulant spaniel said to her: \u201cJemima seems mightily smitten with his Lordship. She\u2019s been making sheep\u2019s-eyes at him all evening. Let me tell you, Mrs. Dangerfield, if Jemima was my daughter I\u2019d find a way to get her out of his company\u2014I admire his Lordship\u2019s exploits on the sea as much as anyone, but his reputation with women is none of the best, you can take my word for that.\u201d\n \n Amber was horrified. \u201cOh, heaven!

The grave yawns for you! Awake and repent!\u201d She pushed back the curtains and looked out. He was walking swiftly by, just beneath her window, a half-naked old man with matted hair and a long dark beard, and he brandished his closed fist at the still houses.\n \n Amber looked at him with disgust. \u201cDevil take him!\u201d she muttered. \u201cThe blasted old fool! There\u2019s trouble enough without that caterwauling!\u201d\n \n And then one night, at the end of July, she heard another and far more terrible cry. There came a rumbling of cart-wheels over the cobblestones, the sound of a hand-bell, and a man\u2019s deep voice calling: \u201cBring out your dead! Bring out your dead!\u201d\n \n She looked swiftly at Spong, for Bruce was asleep, and then she rushed to the window. Spong waddled after her, crowding up close. Below they saw a cart, moving slowly, one man in the driver\u2019s seat and another ringing the hand-bell and walking beside it. In the light from the torch carried by a third they could see that the cart was half-filled with bodies, piled indiscriminately, flung one on top of another.

There were dirty green circles beneath her eyes and the lower part of her face was shiny with the bile and saliva which had dried there; she had not vomited at all for the past three hours.\n \n The woman shook her head. \u201cShe\u2019s mighty sick, your Lordship.

Yes, sir.\u201d\n \n Mrs. Sykes, who told Bruce that she had been a wet-nurse but had lost her job because her husband had died of the plague, worked hard throughout the day.

No matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was\n made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious\n mind could contemplate with edification.

There is no school in\n all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their\n compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the\n most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always\n the longest and the most relentlessly pious.

Ten\n o'clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began\n to wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village\n betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the\n silence and the ghosts.

Some day it may seem worth while to take up the\n story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they\n turned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that\n part of their lives at present.\n \n \n", "ellipsisphrase": "", "complete": true, "narratedtime": 1.0, "subjectivetime": 0, "ellipsistime": 0, "idx": 283}], "metadata": {"source": "gutenberg", "birthyr": "1835", "imprint": "", "selectedby": "other", "originalid": "TwaiMTS.txt", "gender": "m", "title": "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer", "docid": "TwaiMTS", "firstpub": "1876", "numwords": "69818", "author": "Twain, Mark", "date": "1876"}, "chunkct": 284}}
